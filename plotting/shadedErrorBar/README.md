# shadedErrorBar

shadedErrorBar is a MATLAB function that creates a continuous shaded error region around a line rather than discrete bars. 
The error region can either be specified explicitly or calculated on the fly based upon function handles. 
Handles of the plot objects are returned in a convenient structure. 
You will need OpenGL to get transparency to work.
